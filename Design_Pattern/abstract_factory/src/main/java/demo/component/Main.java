/**
 * As we know in factory pattern we took control of creating object and details by taking type.
 * Now you have to use factory when your application support different product families example Computer can be PC,Server or Assembled.
 * So what client needs to do is just pass the family of the product and that product will be built i.e. created.
 * Since we are dealing with creation of objects it is falling under creational design pattern.
 *
 * You ensure that when we say multiple product families , it should be related.
 *
 * A abstract factory contains main following :
 * 1. Abstract product class , in our case : Button and Checkbox
 * 2. Actual products that is MacButton,WinButton etc.
 * 3.  Abstract factory - which helps for interacting for creation and product factories will extend that to ensure right
 *      product gets created. - Here UIFactory
 * 4. Actual product factories - WinUIFactory , MacUIFactory
 * 5. Client - Application will take the respective factory and creates object, and then you can paint UI.
 *
 * Java lib example which is most famous that DOM Parser .It uses abstract factory pattern for creations.
 * The DocumentBuilderFactory is an abstract factory, a factory that is created as a new instance of DocumentBuilderFactory and the Document is an interface that is implemented by the factory to return the response.
 * We don't know here which type of DocumentBuilder we got but based on our input it has given correct instance.
 *
