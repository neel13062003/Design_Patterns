/**
 * As mentioned in Lazy Initialization if our get instance method invoked by two thread at the
 * same time then there are chances that two objects created, and we violate singleton pattern.
 * To avoid we have two choices :
 * 1. Create getinstance synchronized so that only one instance can invoke that method. However, disadvantage is lets say
 * there are 3 thread t1 is inside getinstance and t2,t3 waiting. Now t2 will get into method and simply return instance created by
 * t1 and t3 still waiting. So it had lead to unnecessary of locks.
 *
 * 2. To avoid we have synchronized block which we will implement here.
